## 🚀 DevLog: Building a Task Manager with Integrated AI

Today, I’m excited to share the development journey of my AI-Powered Task Manager, a tool designed to boost productivity by organizing tasks and leveraging AI for automatic tagging.

### 🔹 Stage 1: Core Design and Functionality
The project began with implementing the essential features of a task manager:
- Add tasks: Allows users to input new tasks and save them in a JSON file.
-  Complete/Delete tasks: Mark tasks as done (✅) or remove them from the list.
- Data persistence: Tasks are stored in tasks.json to maintain state between sessions.

Tech stack: Python, Tkinter (for the GUI), JSON.

### 🔹 Stage 2: AI Integration with Ollama
To add value, I integrated Ollama, a tool for running local language models. The AI is used for:
- Auto-tagging tasks: Analyzes task descriptions and assigns tags like "Urgent," "Meeting," or "General."
- Availability check: The system verifies if Ollama is installed before enabling AI features.

Example:
- If a task contains "meeting," the AI tags it as ["Meeting", "Work"].
- If the task includes "urgent," it assigns ["Urgent", "High Priority"].

### 🔹 Stage 3: Task Recommendations
To help prioritize work, I added a recommendation system based on:
- Simulated user mood.
- Priority tags: Tasks marked as "Urgent" appear first.

Outcome:
- The interface suggests the most urgent task to the user.

### 🔹 Stage 4: User-Friendly Interface
The GUI was designed to be intuitive and visually appealing:
- Colors: Completed tasks in light green (✅), pending tasks in yellow (⏳).
- Highlighted buttons:
    - Activate AI (orange) for auto-tagging.
    - Recommend Task (purple) for suggestions.

### 🔹 Challenges and Learnings
1. Ollama Integration: Ensuring the system works even if Ollama isn’t installed required robust error handling.
2. Data Persistence: Using JSON simplified storage, but handling edge cases (e.g., corrupt files) was key.
3. Intuitive UI: Tkinter enabled rapid development, though customization options were limited.

### 🔹 Next Steps
- Enhance the AI model: Use a more advanced model for contextual tagging.
- Cloud sync: Enable access to tasks across multiple devices.
- Notifications: Add reminders for urgent tasks.
