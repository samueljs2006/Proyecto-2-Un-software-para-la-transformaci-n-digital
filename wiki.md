‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.json          # Task database
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ task_manager.py     # Logic + GUI
```
##  Dependencies

### Essentials
| Component | Minimum Version| Installation |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| Python     | 3.7            | `sudo apt install python3` |

ollama --version
```
##  Key Features

### Basic Management
```python
def add_task():
    """Adds a task with empty field validation"""
    
def complete_task():
    """Marks a task as ‚úÖ completed"""
```
### SAI System
```

### Recommendation Algorithm
1. Filters tasks with "Urgent" tag
2. Sorts by age
3. Selects the most prioritized task

##  Graphical Interface

##  DevLog: Building a Task Manager with Integrated AI

Today, I‚Äôm excited to share the development journey of my AI-Powered Task Manager, a tool designed to boost productivity by organizing tasks and leveraging AI for automatic tagging.

### üîπ Stage 1: Core Design and Functionality
The project began with implementing the essential features of a task manager:
- Add tasks: Allows users to input new tasks and save them in a JSON file.
-  Complete/Delete tasks: Mark tasks as done (‚úÖ) or remove them from the list.
- Data persistence: Tasks are stored in tasks.json to maintain state between sessions.

Tech stack: Python, Tkinter (for the GUI), JSON.

### üîπ Stage 2: AI Integration with Ollama
To add value, I integrated Ollama, a tool for running local language models. The AI is used for:
- Auto-tagging tasks: Analyzes task descriptions and assigns tags like "Urgent," "Meeting," or "General."
- Availability check: The system verifies if Ollama is installed before enabling AI features.

Example:
- If a task contains "meeting," the AI tags it as ["Meeting", "Work"].
- If the task includes "urgent," it assigns ["Urgent", "High Priority"].

### üîπ Stage 3: Task Recommendations
To help prioritize work, I added a recommendation system based on:
- Simulated user mood.
- Priority tags: Tasks marked as "Urgent" appear first.

Outcome:
- The interface suggests the most urgent task to the user.

### üîπ Stage 4: User-Friendly Interface
The GUI was designed to be intuitive and visually appealing:
- Colors: Completed tasks in light green (‚úÖ), pending tasks in yellow (‚è≥).
- Highlighted buttons:
    - Activate AI (orange) for auto-tagging.
    - Recommend Task (purple) for suggestions.

### üîπ Challenges and Learnings
1. Ollama Integration: Ensuring the system works even if Ollama isn‚Äôt installed required robust error handling.
2. Data Persistence: Using JSON simplified storage, but handling edge cases (e.g., corrupt files) was key.
3. Intuitive UI: Tkinter enabled rapid development, though customization options were limited.

### üîπ Next Steps
- Enhance the AI model: Use a more advanced model for contextual tagging.
- Cloud sync: Enable access to tasks across multiple devices.
- Notifications: Add reminders for urgent tasks.
